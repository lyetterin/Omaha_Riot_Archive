      <h1>Analysis of Perspectives</h1><br/>
      
      <p>The Monitor serves to inform the public of all the incriminating details of the riot
         and lynching, including specific details such as who was involved, who had been criminally
         charged, and also who had been injured. Instead of telling their viewers what to think
         about the riot, instead they present all the proper evidence intended so that their
         audience could form their own conclusions on what had happened. The majority of the
         article contains lists of assaulters, times and locations of events, eye-witness accounts,
         and even statements from official authorities to add credibility to the story. What
         is important to note here is that any source that The Monitor decided to include that
         was not a piece of factual information or evidence from the event was supporting the
         narrative that yellow journalism was to blame for the uprising. It is evident that
         the quotations provided by the ministers in Omaha were emphasizing the fact that the
         misinformation that was being spread by the mainstream media at the time was the true
         culprit of violence. County Attorney Shotwell attested to this idea as well, providing
         a specific example of one of the many wrongful assumptions that were made by journalists
         that added more fuel to the fire.</p>
      
      <p>On the contrary, The Omaha World Herald focused its attention mainly on the Mayor's
         whereabouts and where the officers were stationed in the courthouse when the rioters
         set the courthouse on fire. They do not provide details on the disturbing acts of
         the rioters, nor do they provide information on who was involved. Instead, they focus
         mainly on how Mayor Smith was taken by the mob and hanged multiple times, as a result
         of him trying to protect the black prisoner, Will Brown, from being injured. They
         also include details of the Mayor's current state of health while inside the hospital,
         and include how he is still receiving death threats because the public believes that
         he is wrong for protecting black people in court.</p>
      
      <p>When further analyzing these two very different publications, there are a few major
         takeaways. The first one being that The Monitor published its first article about
         the event on October 9th, almost ten days after the incident, whereas the Evening
         World Herald published its first article on September 29th. Secondly, The Monitor
         had four pages of descriptive information regarding the traumatic events that happened
         on September 28th and 29th, whereas The Omaha World Herald only published two pages
         which lacked sufficient descriptions and data points. Not only this, but The Monitor
         had an entire different definition of the event, stating that the race riot should
         not be labeled as that, and instead be known solely as a lynching. Their reasoning
         for this was that a race riot would have resulted in much more severe outcomes, such
         as invading the communities of property-owning black people and carrying out threats
         away from the courthouse. Regardless of the two contrasting stories, the purpose of
         this analysis is to understand how deceptive the media has been in the past and where
         it can lead to. It makes us question if targeted ethnic marketing or advertising should
         be considered ethical, or if the current state of our media today should be to blame
         for the division and racism that is embedded into our political systems and daily
         lives. </p>

            and Celia [Schockley] Smith. In 1885 he graduated from University of Iowa College
            of Law with an LL.B degree was admitted to the bar. Smith ran for Omaha of Mayor,
            as a democrat, in 1918, and beat incumbent Mayor &#x201c;Cowboy&#x201d; Jim Dahlman on a reform
            ticket. During the riot Smith was strung up and almost hanged by a mob of disgruntledly
            white men. Though Smith finished the rest of his term as mayor, his passion for politics
            never quite returned. Smith died in Omaha on May 21, 1930 and was buried in Forest
            Lawn Memorial Park in Douglas County, Nebraska.</p>

            19 year old girl. Brown was a 41 years old packinghouse worker. After being seized
            by the mob, Brown was beaten to the point of unconsciousness, his clothes were torn
            off, and he was dragged behind a car to the lynching site, a lamp pole on the south
            side of the courthouse at 18th and Harney. Brown has strung up, hung, and riddled
            with bullets. Later Brown's body was brought down, tied behind a car, and towed to
            the intersection of 17th and Dodge. Brown's body was severely burned and dragged through
            the downstown streets. Pieces of the rope used to lynch Brown were sold for 10 cents
            each. Brown maintained his innocence until his dying breath. Information about who
            Brown was prior to being identified by Agnes Loebeck is currently unavailable.</p>

            Loebeck. Loebeck, alongside her escort Millard Hoffman, was the victim of the assault
            that led to the lynching of Will Brown. Loebeck was described as a pretty brown-eyed
            girl, with sweet, modest manner. At the time of the assault Loebeck worked as a shaker
            at the Model steam laundry. She was a Catholic and a member of St. Patrick's parish.
            According to Loebeck, whilst returning home at midnight from a movie on September
            25, 1919, she and Hoffman were robbed, dragged down the hill, and assaulted by a Black
            gunman. Loebeck identified Brown by his clothing, shoes, and voice. Loeback later
            married Millard Hoffman and died in her home in Douglas County, Nebraska on May 01,
            1966. Loeback maintained that is was Will Brown who assaulted her and Hoffman.</p>

No one was ever held accountable for his lynching. Smith buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery. No information about who Smith was prior to his lynching can be found at this time.</p>

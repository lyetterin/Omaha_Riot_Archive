      <p class="byline">Fought to the Last to Protect Life of Will Brown—Citizen Three Times Took Mob Noose From Mayor's Neck—Cut Down From Light Pole</p>
      
      <p>REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS EARLY TODAY—NO VISITORS PERMITTED</p>
      <br></br>
      
      
      <p><a href="Annotations3.html#edsmith">Mayor Ed P. Smith</a>, who narrowly escaped hanging at the hands of the mob at 10:30 last night,
         was reported to be resting as easily as could be expected at the Ford hospital this afternoon.</p>
      
      <p>He has regained consciousness, but his condition is still serious.</p>
      
      <p>His physician, <a href="Annotations3.html#edhenry">Dr. E. C. Henry</a>, refused to comment upon his chances of recovery further
         than to say that they were as good as could to be expected under the circumstances.</p>
      
      <p>An X-ray exasmination of the Mayor's dead was made at noon by Doctors Tyler and Liston.
         The exmination brought out that the mayor had not suffered a fractured skull as at first feared.</p>
      
      <p>Cerebrial congestion, however, is possible. This is expected to be brought out at
         a clinic to be held by Dr. Henry this afternoon.</p>
      
      <p>The blow over the right eye, the X-ray examination showed, probably was caused by
         a blunt instrument or a brick. Fears that this might be a bullet wound were dispelled
         by the examination.</p>
      
      <br></br>  
      
      
      <p>In Delirious State</p>
      
      <p>The major regained consciousness at 5 o'clock this morning. At 9 o'clock Dr. Henry
         considered sufficient to justify informing him of the fatal results of the mob attack.</p>
      
      <p>While unconscious last night, the mayor was somewhat delirious and in his delirium
         constantly inquired as to the fate of the mob's victim. "They can't have him," he
         kept repeating. "Mob rule shall not prevail in Omaha."</p>
      
      <p>It was not until 9 o'clock this morning, four hours after he regained consciousness,
         that Dr. Henry permitted <a href="Annotations3.html">his daughter</a> to inform him that the negro had been captured
         and hanged by the mob.</p>
      
      <p>Upon regaining consciousness the mayor's first words were to ask if any one had been
         killed. He was told one man had lost his life.</p>
      
   <p>Vistors were not permitted to see the mayor. Even <a href="Annotations3.html#oleson">Ole Olson</a>, the mayor's private secretary, 
      and <a href="Annotations3.html#frhowell">Frank Howell</a>, a close friend, who were callers at the hospital early this morning were
         told they could not see the mayor today.</p>
      
      <br></br>
      
      
      <p>Decide to Tell Him</p>
      
      <p>It was at the suggestion of Mr. Howell that Dr. Henry permitted the mayor to learn
         the news that the negro had been hanged.</p>
      
      <p>"If his condition at all warrants it I would advise telling him," said Mr. Howell.
         "I know him so well I am sure that he is the type of man who if he wants to know should
         be told even though the news is bad news."</p>
      
      <p>The mob's attack on the mayor followed his repeated attempts to save the negro from the angry mob.
         Mayor Smith arrived at the court house shortly after 6 o'clock last night, according to <a href="Annotations3.htmlcczim">City Commissioner
         Zimman</a>, who was at the scene when the city's chief executive drove up in an automobile.</p>
      
      <p>He immediately went into the court house where he remained in company with <a href="Annotations3.html#djringer">Police Commissioner Ringer</a>
         and <a href="Annotations3.html#maberstein">Chief of Police Eberstein</a> until 10:30.</p>
      
      <p>During the four hours they were in the court house the mayor, Ringer and Eberstein
         remained on the fourth floor of the building, after Eberstein had stationed his officers
         on all the floors and in the stairways.</p>
      
      <br></br>
      
      
      <p>Mayor Was Determined</p>
      
      <p>According to Ringer and Eberstein, the mayor was firm in his conviction to uphold
         law and order to the last minute, "We were determined to protect our prisoner to the
         end,"declared Chief Eberstein. "The mayor was most emphatic in his determination to
         stand by the ship, as we all were for that matter. And we would have protected him,
         too, if they had not smoked us out with the fire."</p>
      
      <p>The mayor, Ringer and Eberstein were in the sheriff's office on the fourth floor with
         several police officers when the smoke became so thick they were forced to move. According
         to Ringer and Eberstein, they had to tie handkerchiefs and rags over their faces to
         breath and one or two the officers were almost overcome.</p>
      
      <p>After investigating the main stairways, it was found the smoke was too dense to warrant
         an attempt to escape from the building by this route, so they started for the winding
         stairway which encircles the freight elevator shaft. They became tangled in their
         directions and went up to the roof, where <a href="Annotations3.html#miclerk">Sheriff Clark</a> and his deputies were guarding the county jail prisoners.</p>
      
      <p>Then the sheriff tried out the back stairway and going down it as far as the second
         floor and a found escape possible by this route. He informed Mayor Smith and Commissioner
         Ringer and they started down. </p>
      
      <br></br>
      
      
      <p>Went Back For Chief</p>
      
      <p>Ringer accompanied the mayor as far as the second floor and then discovered Chief
         Eberstein was not present. Upon starting down he had believed the chief was right
         behind him and the mayor.</p>
      
      <p>"I turned to go back for the chief,"said Ringer,"taking the steps two at a time. That
         was the last time I saw the mayor."</p>
      
      <p>Mayor Smith apparently had continued on down when Ringer turned back to look for the
         chief and unaccompanied fell into the hands of the mob.</p>
      
      <p>The mob by this time had reached that state where it exhibited no regard for consequences
         and the mayor was seized by a band of thirty or forty persons, according to <a href="Annotations3.html#hifranklin">Hird Stryker</a>, 
         1317 Park avenue, who was an eye-witness. The mayor was seized on Harney street
         in front of the Keeline building, according to Stryker.</p>
      <br></br>
      
      Continued on Page 15, Column 7.
      <br></br>
      
      <p>After threatening him and then beating him, members of the mob screamed demands for
         the release of the prisoner, according to Stryker. The mayor, however, refused and
         insisted that the mob permit law, order and justice to pursue its course.</p>
      
      <p>The mayor's refusal to conform to their demands infuriated the mob and willing hands
         slipped around the mayor's neck. Stryker pled with the crowd to release the city's
         executive and then sought assistance from bystanders, who were taking no part in the
         demonstration. His pleas, however, were without result.</p>
      
<p><a href="Annotation3s.html"#runorgard>Russell Norgard</a>, 3719 Leavenworth street, is credited by several witnesses with saving the mayor's
         life while the mob was dragging him from in front of the Keeline building to Sixteenth
         and Harney streets, three times Norgard gamely slipped the noose from the mayor's
         throat. Each time the mob replaced it, but Norgard perservered in his efforts to save
         the mayor and by keeping hold of the noose prevented the mob from drawing it tight.</p>
      
      <p>Only Norgard's intervention, witnesses say, prevented the mob from choking the mayor
         to death while dragging him to Sixteenth and Harney streets.</p>
      
      <p>When the mob reached this intersection, the rope was thrown over an electric light
         pole and drawn taught.</p>
      
      <p>The mayor swung clear off the ground. Then an automobile carrying <a href="Annotations3.html">Detectives Charley Van Dusen</a>, 
         <a href="Annotations3.html#acandersen">A.C. Anderson</a> and <a href="Annotations3.html#lltoland">Lloyd Toland</a> and with <a href="Annotations3.html"#bedanbaum>State Agent Benny Danbaum</a> at the wheel swept swiftly into 
         the intersection. Anderson stood up in the car and cut the rope. The three detectives then pulled 
         the mayor into the car and Danbaum drove out with all his power on, knocking down several
         persons in making the escape.</p>
      
      <p>The mayor then was taken to the police station and then to the hospital.</p>
      
      <p>The mayor was armed with a small revolver, according to Chief of Police Eberstein.
         The chief added, however, that the gun was so small it wouldn't have hurt anybody
         and the mayor kept it in his pocket.</p>
      
      <p>Only once did the mayor use it at all. He fired one shot, apparently in the hope of
         intimidating the mob, at the floor of the court house rotunda when attempting to make
         a plea from the balcony of the court house for the mob to desist. While the mayor
         attempted to make his appeal, bullets from members of the mob were fired in every
         direction, some of them whizzing perilously close to the city's executive.</p>
      
<p>Chief of Police Eberstein also sough to quiet the mob by making an appeal from the
         court house blacony, but his efforts were equally fruitless.</p>
      
      <p>The mayor's fortitude in sticking to his stand to prevent the lynching of the negro
         if possible, even when he was hanging by his neck from the electric light pole at
         Sixteenth and Harney streets was nothing short of remarkable, witnesses declared.</p>
      
      <p>According to Hird Stryker, fully 2,000 persons watched the manhandling of the mayor
         without lifting a hand in his protection while a gang of 200 menaced him.</p>
      
      <p>"Only about 200 of the hoodlum type had a hand in that," said Stryker, "while at least
         2,000 persons looked on and did nothing.</p>
      
      <p>When the mayor was seized by a mob at Seventeenth and Harney streets, a solder in
         uniform is alleged to have shouted:</p>
      
      <p>"He shot; Mayor Smith shot me."</p>
      
      <p>The mayor attempted to expostulate to the crowd.</p>
      
      <p>"We don't want anything from you," shouted one of the rioters.</p>
      
<p><a href="Annotations3.html#jemorris">Police Sergeant Morris</a> and an unidentified woman sought to lift the mayor into a police emergency car parked
         against the curb. The crowd overturned the automobile and set it afire.</p>
      
      <p>A telephone call was received at the Ford hospital this morning.</p>
      
      <p>"We're coming over to lynch the mayor if he don't resign,"said a woman's voice. The
         woman said she was president of a woman's auxiliary society, but the telephone operator
         at the hospital did not catch the name and the woman hung up before she could question
         her.</p>
      
      <p>The seriousness of Mayor Smith's condition is greatly aggravated by an old ailment
         of the mayor's. Some years ago an operation for an absecess was performed on the mayor's
         ear and resulting complications have given him trouble in his head ever since.</p>
      
      <p>Some time ago, prior to his election as mayor, he was seized with an acute attack
         of this ailment while in the court house and he fell unconscious.</p>

            <p>Smith, a negro, was lynched abou<supplied reason="page torn" resp="#ly_er">t</supplied> a quarter-century ago from the ol<supplied reason="page torn" resp="#ly_er">d</supplied> county jail on the same site and swung from a trolley pole at Seventeeth and Harney. He had outrages <persName><ref target= "#edsmith">a white girl</ref></persName>, daughter of a Union Pacific shop man, and she was believed his fifth victim.</p>
            <p>A mob with sledge hammers and cold chisels and railway rails stormed the old jail and after several hours got their victim. He was so badly scared that he was more dead than alive when strung up. <persName><ref target= "#maboyd">Mayor Boyd</ref></persName> ordered the crowd to disperse but it paid no attention. The he called out the firemen to play streams on the crowd and disperse it, but the mob cut the hose.</p>

      <p class="byline">Examining the Rhetoric of a prominent white Newspaper Differed from a prominent Black
         Newspaper in their reporting of the lynching of Will Brown</p>
      
      <p>Following the reconstruction of 1910s, thousands of African Americans were recruited
         to come work as strikebreakers at the meatpacking plants located in Omaha, Nebraska.
         By the 1920s, the number of African Americans doubled to over 10,000 which was the
         second-highest concentration of blacks in America at the time. This created a great
         social divide in the community, where the working-class whites were showing great
         hostility towards blacks. As tensions between white and black workers in the stockyards
         were festering, on September 25, 1919, 19-year-old <span class="label">Agnes Loebeck</span>
         reported that she had been raped. Local media reports were quick to report and broadcast
         this disturbing allegation, and one day later Will Brown was arrested by police and
         later identified by Loebeck. This series of events is what ultimately led to the unforgettable
         Omaha Race Riot and public lynching of <span class="label">Will Brown</span>.</p>
      <br></br>
      
      <p>The purpose of this site is to demonstrate the two different media portrayals of the
         events that took place in front of the Douglas County Courthouse in downtown Omaha
         on September 28th and 29th. The first newspaper that will be examined is The Omaha
         Monitor which was famously known for being devoted to the interests of colored Americans
         and was the most widely read of all African American newspapers in Omaha during that
         time. To compare this rhetoric that was mainly curated towards blacks, publications
         from the Omaha World-Herald will be further analyzed, as this daily newspaper was
         run by predominantly white editors and publishers. </p>

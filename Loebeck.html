      <p><a href="Annotations3.html#agloebeck">Agnes Loebeck</a>, the 20-year-old victim of the assault which led to last night's lynching, this morning
         declared that she was absolutely convinced as to Brown's identity and that he was
         the man who attacked her that night. The girl's mother said she was glad the negro
         was lynched.</p>
      
      <p>"I said he was not a very tall man, and the minute the police brought him here I recognized
         him," said Agnes today at her home, 3228 South Second street.</p>
      
      <p>"I knew him from his hat and his clothes and his shoes and from his face and his size.
         As soon as he spoke I recognized his voice. When the police brought him here he said
         'Let me have a fair trial,' and I recognized his voice instantly. As he pushed us
         ahead of him down the hill that night he kept saying 'shut up' all the time and I
         remembered his voice distinctly."</p>
      
      <p>The point where the negro first came upon Agnes Loebeck and <a href="Annotations3.html#mihoffman">Millard Hoffman</a>, her crippled escort, who was held at bay by a gun, is only a short distance from
         a bright arc light.</p>
      
      <p>Everything is strangely quiet today about the little home occupied by the Loebecks.
         Agnes, who was in a state of hysteria Sunday afternoon and evening as reports of the
         rioting reached her, is somewhat calmer today. She lies or sits on a couch in the
         modest parlor, her small sister always close beside her. Her head, which aches almost
         continuously, is bound with a handkerchief and she plucks at the shawl about her shoulders
         with sort of a nervous terror.</p>
      
      <p>She is a pretty brown-eyed girl, with sweet, modest manner. She is employed at the
         Model steam laundry, where she is a shaker. She is a Catholic and a member of St.
         Patrick's parish, where she goes to mass each Sunday at 9 o'clock.</p>
      
      <p><a href="Annotations3.html#joloebeck">Mrs.Joseph Loeback</a>, a hard working brown-eyes little woman, came from the wash tub this morning to talk
         to her daughter and give her a word of comfort occasionally.</p>
      
      <p>"I'm glad they killed the negro,"said the little mother. "I raised thirteen children,
         nine of them still living, and to think that this terrible thing should have happened
         to one of my daughters."</p>
      
      <p>Here the woman's voice broke. "No one will ever known how I felt that night when they
         brought Agnes home,"she added. "We've lived right here in this house for twenty-seven
         years. We have never wronged any one. We once had negro neighbors and I always taught
         my children to treat them kindly. I told them negroes could not help it because they
         were black and now to think this should have happened to our family."</p>
      
      <p>"My daughter will never be the same again." the mother sobbed. "You should have seen
         her a few days ago. She was gay and happy and had rosy cheeks. Now she won't eat and
         she is getting thin and is nervous and can't sleep."</p>

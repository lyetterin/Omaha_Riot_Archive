         the court house on September 28.</p>
      
      <p>Fifteen of the sixteen jurors are the unexcused portion of a panel of twenty-three
         drawn by chance from the voting list of the county. The sixteenth is Henry W. Dunn,
         chosen by Sheriff Clark to complete the jury.</p>
      
      <p>John W. Towle, president of the Omaha Structural Steel Works, and chief inspector
         of a government ship building yard during the war, is foreman of the jury, by appointment
         of the court.</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      
      <p>Other Fifteen Jurors.</p>

      <p>Questioned as to Attitude</p>
      
      <p>After the jurors had sworn to make full and careful investigation to determine the
         existence of crime and the identity of criminals, and to indict such criminals without
         fear or favor, presiding Judge Redick read the court's charge which set forth the
         jury's duty and powers in general terms.</p>
      
      <p>A suggestion of the emergency which brought the calling of the special grand jury,
         was contained in Judge Redick’s charge and in the questions which he asked of the
         jurors.   </p>
      
      <p>After the usual routine questions, relative to physical disability, past jury service,
         occupation and past criminal record, the judge asked:</p>
      
      <p>"Are you or any one of you, opposed to the strict enforcment of the criminal law?"</p>
      
      <p>None replied.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you, or anyone of you, opposed to organized government?” the judge asked.</p>
      
      <p>None answered.</p>

      <h1>NEGRO HELD lN WISNER ASSAULT CASE FREED</h1><br/>
      
      <p>Charles Jones. Negro, 2829 B street, South Side, who was arrested by soldiers on a
         street car for alleged criminal assault on Mrs. W. G. Wisner, 2922 Burdette street,
         was released Thursday at 6 p. m. by military authorities, after a thorough examination.
         The military authorities seriously question the woman's story.</p>
      
      <p>The condition of Clifton Westin, 4820 Pierce street, who was wounded in the chest
         during the rioting Sunday night, was reported to be serious by authorities at the
         Lord Lister hospital.</p>

      <p>Two hundred men are at work clearing up the debris in the court house, putting in
         temporary windows, repairing the steam heating system and getting the building in
         condition to be heated when the weather becomes cold.</p>
      
      <p>The window frames in many places being entirely burned away, temporary windows are
         being placed about two feet inside the inner wall so as not to interfere with putting
         in the permanent frames and windows when they can be obtained.</p>
      
      <p>The county commissioners, in the emergency, have drawn money from the miscellaneous
         fund to pay for this work, pending action by the legislature to provide funds to do
         the actual work of rebuilding.</p>

      <p>Omaha Pulpits Ring With Uncompromising Denunciation of the Mob Spirit</p>     
      
      <br/>

      <p>CHARGE YELLOW JOURNALISM WITH RESPONSIBILITY OF RIOT</p>
      
      <p>NOTHING could more plainly attest the disapproval of the best citizenship of Omaha
         of the lynching and mob violence which has cast a blot upon the city than the unanimity
         with which the pulpits uncompromisingly denounced these unmitigated evils Sunday.
         Liturgical churches like the Roman Catholic, Episcopalian and Lutheran, which ordinarily
         are considered conservative in such matters, were one with the non-liturgical churches
         in their ringing messages for the preservation of law and order. Roman Catholic, Protestant
         and Jew spoke with a united voice which could leave no doubt in the mind of any of
         the sentiment of the religious forces of this community. There was remarkable unanimity
         of sentiment that tile mob spirit had been awakened in this community by the regrettable
         methods of yellow journalism, in exaggerated reports of revolting crimes, an inflammatory
         practice demanding suppression. The following excerpts are representative of the pulpit
         utterances:</p>
      
      <p>Speaking at All Saints’ Episcopal church, the Rt. Rev. Ernest V. Shayler, bishop of
         Nebraska, reiterated his statement made to the press deploring the indelible blot
         mob violence had placed upon the city and traced it to the unChristian living of so
         many in their homes. “We must have Christianity in the heart and we must have it in
         our daily lives. Respect for law must be inculcated in the heart of the young. Law
         must be enforced. All men must be respected for their per-sonal worth and treated
         as children of God.”</p>
      
      <p>Speaking on "Omaha, the Mob and the Church,” the Rev. Titus Lowe, pastor of the First
         Methodist church, said the recent riot here could be traced in large measure to the
         exaggerated reports of crime and the at-tacks upon the city administration made by
         a local newspaper.</p>
      
      <p>“There is nothing to condone the lynching of the Negro, the malicious destruction
         of property and the shameful attack on the mayor of Omaha," said the speaker.</p>
      
      <p>“The disgrace of a week ago was a challenge, not only to the city officials, but to
         every citizen to stand squarely for the rigid enforcement of the law. It was a challenge
         to the public school system of today, which neglects the teaching of proper respect
         for law and order to our children, and it was a challenge to the</p>

      <p> Christian forces of the city to live a bigger and better life of service.”</p>
      
      <p>The Rev. Charles E. Cobbey, pastor of the First Christian church, in his morning service
         Sunday, discussed “Reverence for the law.” He also laid the blame upon yellow Journalism</p>
      
      <p>“The growing disrespect in Omaha for law and order and the yellow journalism of a
         certain Omaha daily paper made such conditions as those leading to the lynching of
         William Brown possible. It is the belief of many that the entire responsibility for
         the outrage can be placed at the feet of a few men and one Omaha paper.”</p>
      
      <p>The excesses of Sunday night, he said were the product of a reckless spirit of lawlessness,
         engendered by peristent newspaper propaganda.</p>
      
      <p>The Rev. Charles W. Savidge of the People’s church spoke on the causes which he said
         led to the outbreak, and upon what should be done to prevent a repetition of the riot.“For
         many years Omaha has been slack in enforcement of the law,” said the pastor. “In the
         past Omaha has sown the wind, and she has reaped the whirlwind. We have had lately
         a carnival of crime. The people had come to believe there was no justice to be obtained.</p>
      
      <p>“General Wood said, too, that there (was one newspaper in Omaha which by its severe
         critcism of public officials had broken down the respect for authority. But one of
         the greatest causes was the inefficiency and helplessness of the police and those
         who should have commanded them.</p>
      
      <p>"What shall we do? Let us wake up. This town is more sobered ana thoughtful than 1
         have ever before seen it. There is a grim determination that things must change. Let
         a real man be chosen to reorganize and train and command our police. Let the people
         understand that there is such a thing as authority. Let the administration of justice
         be swift and sure, especially as to crimes against women. The city has paid a great
         price for its great sins, but we shall yet find ourselves and we shall be the better
         for this awful baptism of blood and fire."</p>
      
      <p>Speaking on “The Epidemic of Crime; Its Causes and Cure," the Rev. A. A DeLarme. pastor
         of the First Baptist church, paid a tribute to the courage of Mayor Smith in resisting
         the mob at the risk of his own life. “We may be thankful,” said the pastor, "that
         at a time when the countryis overrun with thieves, thugs and murderers, we have as
         our chief executive in Omaha a man of courage and moral principle who is determined
         that the law shall be upheld, even though his life is sacrificed in its defense. “Some
         of the causes leading to this frightful, daredevil orgy of murder and arson Sunday
         night, and of like crimes all over the country, are: “Disobedience to parents and
         insubordination to authority and lack of proper home training.</p>
      
      <p>“Lax law enforcement is another cause of crime. Yellow Journalism is the cause of
         much of the deplorable condition of anarchy and lawlessness in the country today.</p>
      
      <p>“Now what is the cure of this and all like crimes?</p>
      
      <p>“Respect for the law and obedience to it must be more thoroughly im pressed upon the
         youth of the land.</p>       
      
      <p>“A penalty and a punishment for the crime of which this Negro was accused, so drastic,
         so terrible as to make it in the eyes of the law' what It is in the eyes of men. the
         most heinous and execrable in the catalogue of crime.</p>
      
      <p>“Rigid and prompt enforcement of the law when the accused has had a fair trial and
         is found guilty.</p> 
      
      <p>“Speedy trial of these rioters and such punishment as the law prescribes for first
         degree murder. If such things go unpunished an incentive will be furnished in the
         development and explosion of sordid passions in every community where the elements
         that breed such passions exist.”</p>
      
      <p>The Rev. J. Delman Kuykendall, pastor of Plymouth Congregational church, speaking
         on “The Age–Old Problem of Race and Its Only Solution,” said: “All civilization which
         is to insure safety and happiness to the people must rest upon a broad and firm foundation
         of law. and of respect for law."</p>         
      
      <p>The severest possible punishment for the members of the mob was demanded by the speaker.
         He declared that the heavy hand of the law should rest not only on the dupes who were
         pushed into actual leadership of the riot, but upon the skulking gangsters who organized
         the mob. provided it with liquor and guns and sent it out to its devilish work. There
         is every Indication, he declared, that there were some “higher-ups” in this orgy of
         crime, and they should be ferreted out and punished to the limit.</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Kuykendall touched briefly upon the color problem, which he said would never be
         solved either by segregation or by amalgamation of the races. There must be insured
         to every man of whatever color, he said, every human right enjoyed by any one.</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>From Colored Ministers.</p>
      
      <p>Rev. John Albert Williams, speaking at the Church of St. Philip the Deacon on “Righteousness
         and Obedience to Law," stressed the fact that there is world-wide disquietude, the
         birth pangs of emerging nations and groups. America is sharing in this turmoil and
         must prove that democracy is a workable theory. Serious conditions confront us. The
         mob spirit aroused here by sensational newspapers show how unsafe are the lives and
         property not only of those who may be guilty of heinous crimes, but of the best and
         most useful citizens. He urged his hearers to cultivate personal righteousness and
         to be always found on the side of law and order. He said we must never yield one moment
         to the suggestion that this is not our country. America is our country, made so by
         the toil and blood of our sires, and we must stand for all the rights of our American
         citizenship, doing our full duty with patience and perseverance to help America come
         into her rightful inheritance.</p>
      
      <p>The Rev. William F. Franklin of Pilgrim Rest Baptist church speaking from the text,
         “Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people,” stated that
         the out breaking of lawlessness in all sections of the country shows that this nation
         is far from righteous and that all must unite to roll away the reproach of sin. There
         must be individual righteousness first before there can lie national righteousness.</p>
      
      <p>The Rev. John Costello of Pleasant Green Baptist, preached an encouraging sermon to
         his congregation from the text, “God is a refuge for His people," in which he called
         attention to the prejudice which so generally prevails. of which Sunday night’s orgy
         was an illustration and urged that loyalty to God would be always a protection.</p>
      
      <p>Rev. Thomas A. Taggart of Bethel Baptist church, speaking on the topic “Kthiopia Shall
         Stretch Forth Her Hand to God,” emphasized the truth that all attempts to crush down
         the Negro people by lawless mobs will come to naught. He urged patience,vigilance
         and preparedness.</p>
      
      <p>Rev. W. H. Wilkinson of Mt. Moriah Baptist church took as his theme “Safety in Christ
         Alone,” stressing the fact that in the temporal affairs of men righteousness is the
         only basis for success and progress all else in vain.</p>

      <p>PRIEST ATTACKS MOB AT FUNERAL OF BOY</p>
      
      <p>“Heaven Cries for Vengeance,” Says Father Stenson at Kites for Louis Young—I Iran
         dm other of Boy Who Helped Lead Mob Says Sermon Not Appropriate.</p>
      
      <p>“Heaven cries out for vengeance against the brutal, bloodthirsty mob that killed this
         boy, wantonly destroyed property and made a murderous attack on our mayor,’’ said
         Father James W. Stenson in a funeral sermon over the body of Louis Young, 16 years
         old, who was killed in Sunday night's rioting. The services were held at St. Philomena's
         church at 9 o’clock Wednesday morning, with burial In Holy Sepulcher cemetery.</p>
      
      <p>The Negro had not been proven guilty of any crime, but even If he had, the law should
         have been allowed to take its proper course. The law 'thou shalt not kill,’ has never
         been repealed and those who violate It must pay the penalty. Jesus Christ shed his
         blood for the redemption of every race, regardless of color.</p>
      
      <p>‘We forget that it was the white man who brought the Negro to this country, held him
         in slavery, sold him on the aution block, and It is the white man who Is now placing
         obstacles in the path of the black man’s progress by such lawless action as that of
         Sunday night. The fires of hatred are burning in the Negro’s breast mainst the white
         man who treats him as a brute rather! than as a human being.</p>
      
      <p>“I appeal to the people of Omaha to uphold the hands of Mayor Smith and the other

      <p>FLAGRANT FALSEHOOD DAMAGES FINKENSTEIN</p>
      
      <p>Rumor That Popular North Side Grocer Was Member of Mob Starts Disastrous Boycott by
         Colored Patrons Report Absolutely False.</p>

      <p>MONITOR INVESTIGATES OWNER GIVES AFFIDAVIT</p>
      
      <p>Swears That He Was Not Out of Store Until Late Sunday Night and Nowhere Down Town
         During Day—Seen in Store Busy on Books by Witnesses Between 7 and 8 O’clock.</p>         
      
      <p>The Finkenstein grocery store, located at Twenty-sixth and Biondo streets, and enjoying
         for years a large trade among the colored residents of that section, saw bankruptcy
         looming large in the not far distant future last: week when customer after customer
         I closed his account and said 1 am through with your store. The business started on
         Thursday evening when the Rev. W. F. Bolts, the popular pastor; of Zion Baptist church,
         who lives with | in a stone's throw of the store, and who had been considered one
         of the store’s best customers for years, came in and called for his account, paid
         it, and said, "I’m sorry, Mannie, we’ve been good friends for years; at least i thought
         so; but now 1 am through with your store for all time.”</p>
      
      <p>"Why, reverend, aren't you joking? What's the matter?”</p>
      
      <p>“No, I am not joking; I was nevermore dead in earnest in my life. It has been reported
         that you were one of the leaders of that mob Sunday night that lynched a Negro and
         burned the court house, and no man that does that, and I know it, can have my trade
         or any of my people's.”</p>
      
      <p>“Why, good heavens, man,” gasped Finkenstein turning pale,'"I had nothing to do with
         it."</p>
      
      <p>"Well, I’m from Missouri, said Zion’s pastor, and I suppose you know what that means.
         It comes mighty straight and you’ve got to show me.”</p>
      
      <p>The report spread like wildfire, and assumed all sorts of shapes from the story that
         Mannie Finkenstein led the mob in person to the story that Finkenstein trucks were
         busy transporting gasoline from the store nearly three miles away to the court house.</p>
      
      <p>The Monitor has investigated the story and finds that somebodv has started a falsehood
         which is doing Mr. Finkenstein a great injustice. Monitor readers know that if The
         Monitor believed that the reports were true, that we would openly advocate a boy-
         jcolt on the store. The Monitor has its own theory as to how the story started. It
         is this Louis Young, the 16-year-oid boy who was shot and killed leading the mob,
         was, until a few months ago delivery boy for the Finkenstein grocery. Many people
         spoke of him as that Finkenstein grocery boy or delivery boy.. And it is not at all
         unlikely that someone said "That Finkenstein grocery boy led the mob."</p>
      
      <p>Mannie Finkenstein, who is most active in the man [unknown] tore, has furnished, [unknown],
         wornstatement:</p>
      
      <p>I, Mannie Finkenstein, of Finkenstein Grocery Store, 26th and Blondo streets, first
         being duly sworn, do solemnly swear that I was not even down town at any time, afternoon
         or night, Sunday, September 2s, 1919, and therefore bad no part either directly or
         indirectly tn the lynching or rioting, nor did any member or members of our family,
         who were all at home; norwas any. gasoline or anything else issued to any of the rioters
         from our store which is nearly three miles distant from the court house.</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>MANNIE FINKENSTEIN.</p>

      <p>Wm. Franklin, Notary Public.</p>
      
      <p>Mrs. C. L. Wilkinson of 2633 Patrick avenue, told The Monitor that she was on her
         way home from the meeting of the N. A. A. C. P. at Pilgrim Rest Baptist church a few
         minutes after To’clock and saw Mannie Finkenstein at work in the store.</p>
      
      <p>Charles Smith, who lives above tnestore also states that he saw Finkenstein at work
         in the store during the evening.</p>
      
      <p>These corroborate Mr. Finkenstein. And moreover this is a fact that clinches the argument:
         The authorities. military and police, have been arresting everybody against whom there
         was the faintest suspicion that he was a member of the mob. If the report were true.
         Mr. Finkenstein would be now in jail without bail awaiting trial. Mr. Finkenstein
         had nothing to do with the mob and all hie customers who have been satisfied with
         hts goods and service all these years owe it to themselves as well as to Mr. Finkenstein
         to see to tt that his business is not destroyed because of a damaging falsehood w'hioh
         haB been given wide circulation.</p>

      <p>SIX MEN TO FACE MURDER CHARGES ARE NOW IN JAIL</p>
      
      <p>Their Names Are Kept Secret at Request of General Wood.</p>      
      
      <p>County Attorney Shotwell Thursday announced that six men, against whom charges of
         murder will be filed in connection with the lynching of Will Brown. Negro, and Sunday’s
         disturbances, are among the eighty persons held in connection with the riot, and are
         at present tn the county jail, where they are held without bonds, as the military
         authorities have requested.</p>
      
      <p>Acting upon instructions fromMajor General Leonard Wood, County (Attorney Shotwell
         withheld the names of these six men. No first-degree murder charges will he filed
         against the men under arrest until the special session of the grand jury is called.</p>
      
      <p>Evidence will be presented direct to the grand jury, according to County Attorney
         Shotwell unless an emergency arises, making it necessary to file charges before that
         time.'</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>Can’t Release Innocent Men Now.</p>
      
      <p>"There Is, perhaps, some false Information filed with us already,” said the county
         attorney. "Some men now under arrest on investigation of charges may be able to prove
         they were not even in the mob, but we are unable to release them from custody as long
         as the military is in charge.</p>
      
      <p>"At least six men now under arrest will face first degree murder charges if the grand
         Jury acts favorably on information we now have. We have positive proof, we feel, on
         which to base charges of first-degree murder.</p>
      
      <p>"This list doubtless will be swelled as new arrests are constantly being made."God
         make my life a little staff Whereon the weak may rest, That so what health and strength
         I have May serve my neighbors best.Go to sleep without super, but rise without debt.

      <p>SHOTWELL KEEPS RECORD STRAIGHT</p>
      
      <p>County Attorney Asserts That Stories Of Alleged Leniency Toward Negro Criminals False.</p> 
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>ONE ASSAULT ACQUITTAL AND NO PAROLES</p>
      
      <p>County Attorney Shotwell Indignantly Resents The Statement That His Office lias Been
         Lenlenl With Assntiltcrs Of Women—He Is Backed Up Absolutely By Court Records—</p>               
      
      <p>Reports of these crimes having increased since the Chicago riots, Mr. Shotwell Is
         of the opinion that the criminal element fleeing that city may be In part responsible
         for them.</p>
      
      <p>"The cases of assault against women nearly all occurred after the Chicago riots,”
         he added. "Previous to that period the record was comparatively clean of such outrages.”</p>
      
      <p>The county attorney believes that groundless stories concerning the leniency of courts
         and court officers toward alleged attackers were responsible for the tragedy gave
         out the following interview:</p>
      
      <p>“On July 7 a South Side girl was ravished by a Negro who tied her to a tree. Police
         arrested a suspect and he was identified. Reports were widely circulated, and are
         still heard over the streets, that this prisoner was Released.</p>
          
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>The Ninety-Day Case.</p>
      
      <p>“As a matter of fact he was bound over from the county to the district court, was
         in the "county jail the night of the riot, and is now in state penitentiary at Lincoln
         with the other colored prisoners taken from this jail, In default of $5,000 bonds.</p>
      
      <p>One of the most popular of the fake stories that were used to incite the riot was
         that a colored man had attempted to assault a 9-year-old girl, was arrested, identified
         and given 90 days In the county jail. The facts are that the little girl saw this
         Negro, and thought he was quickening his step toward her. She ran and told her mother.
         The Negro was arrested, but there was no' evidence that he even touched the girl.
         Naturally this was no rape case, but a disorderly conduct complaint was filed against
         him, and he got 90 days. He, too. was on the roof of the court house when Brown was
         lynched.</p>
      
      <p>"Still another story, positively false, was used in stirring up feeling that preceded
         the riot. It was said that a colored man was arrested for an as sault upon a white
         woman, and that she Identified him, but that he was later discharged.</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>Discusses Cullfas Charge.</p>
      
      <p>"in this case her identification was very weak, and the prisoner established a positive
         alibi, bringing in from Iowa the white foreman of a road gang of the Illinois Central
         rail road, who showed by his time-checks that the suspect was in Iowa on the day of
         the assult, and at work.</p>
      
      <p>“This sort of propaganda must cease, because It is false and incites to riot," concluded
         Mr, Shotwell.</p>
         
      <br/>
               
      
      <p>SENATOR WILLIAMS COVETS EX-KAISER WILHELM’S POSITION</p>
      
      <p>Hannibal, Mo., Oct. 6, “Where is our country drifting when a man who is elected by
         the people to help to make laws to govern us will stand in the United States Senate
         chamber and indorse lynching?" was the question asked by Bishop H. Blanton Parks of
         Chicago, in addressing the North Missouri African Methodist conference, which closed
         last night, after five days' session.</p>
      
      <p>“I consider Senator Williams the American kaiser," continued the bishop, “and unless
         this government calls a halt to men in high position condoning crime and criminality,
         the future of our country is dark. That senator who put his approval on lynching is
         guilty of high treason and should be punished.”</p>
      
      <p>Resolutions were passed extending sympathy to Mayor Smith of Omaha, who was assaulted
         by the mob; the same was telegraphed to the official. The conference went on record
         as opposing crime, criminality, anarchy, I. W. W, and bolshevism and all their kindred
         evils, and called upon those who make and construe the law to see that It was properly
         executed.</p>
      
      <p>The conference selected Chillicothe for the next annual session. Revs. N. C. Buren,
         W B. Brooks, W. S. E. Maloney and S. L. Smith were elected delegates to the general
         cot ference, which meets next May in St. Louis. In thlB session bishops are to be
         elected. Among the prominent candidates are Revs. J. R. Ransom, J. C. Caldwell, W.
         Sampson Brooks, A. J. ,.Carey and W. D. Johnson.</p>
      
      <p>Dr. A. Pox preached the educational sermon and Dr. Caldwell delivered a special lecture
         on the Bible. The Session was the best in the history of the organization.</p>

      <p>POLICE OFFICER IS SUSPENDED</p>
      
      <p>William Coulter First Of Several To Face Charges Of Neglect Of Duty In Connection
         With Rioting.</p>      
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>STATED SOME OFFICER GAVE MOB DIRECTIONS</p>
      
      <p>Probe To Secure Fads Will Be Unsparingly Used—Slightest Clue Being Followed In Rigid
         Investigation of Rioters.</p>
      
      <p>WILLIAM COULTER, a patrolman, was suspended October 4 by Chief of Police Eberstein.</p>
      
      <p>The suspension is the first of a number it is expected will be made by the chief of
         police of officers who are alleged to have violated their oath of office during the
         riots of last Sunday night.</p>
      
      <p>Charges will be preferred against Coulter before the city council. Police Commissioner
         Ringer said he did not care at this time to make public the specific acts of Ihe police
         officer, which brought about his suspension.</p>
      
      <p>"He failed to do his duty; that’s about all we care to say about it right now,” said
         Ringer.</p>
      
      <p>Coulter said he had been informed he had been suspended for "something he had said.”</p>
      
      <br/>
       
      
      <p>Says Didn't Yield Badge.</p>
      
      <p>The suspended officer declared he did not urn over his gun or badge to members of
         the mob. "I’d die before I’d give up my gun,” said Coulter.</p>
      
      <p>“Did you say anything that might warrant your suspension?” he was asked.</p>
      
      <p>"I didn’t say a thing." replied the Officer.</p>
      
      <p>Coulter was transferred to the Omaha police force from the South Omaha force upon
         annexation of •South Omaha by Omaha on June 21. 1915. He was appointed to the South
         Omaha force on May 1, 1901.</p>
      
      <p>A thorough investigation of charges that a number of police officers violated their
         oath of office by turning
         their badges and guns over to members of the mob is being made by Commissioner Ringer
         and Chief Eberstein.</p>
      
      <br/>
      
      
      <p>Accumulation of Evidence.</p>
      
      <p>Ringer said he had accumulated evidence showing that police officers were negligent
         in their duty Sunday and suspensions will be made.</p>
      
      <p>Several officers, it is alleged, willingly turned over their guns to the mob leaders.
         They were in sympathy with the movement to lynch Will Brown. One officer is said to
         have "addressed"’ his revolver to himself and "mailed" it at a box in the court House.</p>
      
      <p>The police commissioner is investigating information that it was a police officer
         who gave leaders of the mob directions how to reach the county jail by a back stairway
         and that It was through this information that the mob finally captured the prisoner
         from the officers.</p>
      
      <p>Tills officer is alleged to have furnished leaders of a mob with a diagram of this
         stairway after he had turned over his gun and badge.</p>

      <p>50 LAWYERS AID IN RIOT PROSECUTION</p>
      
      <p>Will Be On Duty Throughout Onj In Gathering Evidence Against Alleged Rioters.</p>      
      
      <p>At the suggestion of County Attorney A. V. Shotwell, over fifty Omaha lawyers have
         volunteered to aid in the gathering of evidence against those in connection with the
         lynching of Will Brown, the attempted hanging of Mayor Smith, the burning of the Douglas
         county court house and the looting of pawnshops Sunday night. The evidence is to be
         placed before the grand jury when it convenes October 8.</p>
      
      <p>At a meeting in the city hall October 3, organization of the lawyers was affected.
         R. M. Switzler was placed in charge of scheduling the lawyers for duty in collecting
         evidence. The attorneys will cooperate with Captain H. P. Maze of the police department
         In gathering material for the prosecution.</p>
      
      <p>Three attorneys will be on duty at all hours of the day and in the evening when the
         occasion demands it, until the grand jury convenes. Head quarters of the attorneys
         will be at room 201 city hall.</p>
      
      <p>Shotwell addressed the organization and outlined the work of the lawyers and the manner
         in which evidence is to be collected.</p>
      
      <p>The attorneys’ duty roster for Friday was announced:</p>

      <p>JUDGE REDICK’S CHARGE TO JURY</p>
      
      <p>That pa[unreadeable] District Judge Redick’s cha[unreadable]o the grand jury which
         relates to the recent rioting follows:</p>
      
      <p>“Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:</p>
      
      <p>“You have been called together at this time to perform one of the most Important duties
         of citizenship. Under ordinary conditions the county attorney and his deputies are
         able to investigate infractio-s of the criminal laws and institute proper proceedings
         to bring the offenders to justice, but an emergency exists at this time which has
         rendered it imperative that they be afforded the assistance of a grand jury. * * *</p>
      
      <p>"The emergency above referred to has been brought about through the efforts of certain
         lawless persons to take the law Into their own hands and administer punishment In
         their own way, without the forms of law and without giving the ones accused of crime
         the opportunity to demand themselves before a Jury of twlve men, or for that matter
         in any way what ever. As a result of their lawless endeavors it is asserted that a
         prisoner In the county jail was forcibly removed therefrom, and hanged, and his body
         dragged through the streets of the city; the mayor of the city attacked and severely
         beaten; the court house of the county set on fire, and seriously damaged; stores and
         ware houses broken into and the contents stolen. “Large numbers of persons are said
         to have been engaged in these activities resulting in the commission of the crimes
         of murder, assault with intent to kill or do great bodily harm, arson, burglary, larceny,
         rioting and many others of less degree.</p>
      
      <p>“If these things have been done, the perpetrators thereof should be punished, not
         only that the criminal laws of the state may be rigidly enforced, but that he lawless
         and criminal elements of the community may not be encouraged to make similar or other
         unlawful onslaughts upon the regularly constituted authorities of the state and all
         subdivisions thereof.</p>
      
      <p>“The constitution of the state of Nebraska provides that ‘No person shall be deprived
         of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.’ This is the guaranty of
         our liberties, a disregard of which involves the destruction of government, and the
         in auguration of a reign of terror.</p>
      
      <p>‘‘You should, therefore, approach the performance of your duties with calm and unbiased
         minds but with a stern determination to uphold the laws of the state and bring all
         offenders to Justice.</p>
      
      <p>“The first and principal matters for your consideration should be to Inquire into
         and true presentment make, if in your opinion justified, of such persons as are now
         held in the county Jail to answer charges preferred against them, especially with
         crimes growing out of the disorders above referred to, and this you should do as speedily
         as possible.</p>
      
      <p>“In this connection you are specially cautioned that you should not allow yourselves
         to be influenced by passion, popular clamor, fear, favor, or prejudice, but should
         make presentment or refuse so to do without regard to any of those considerations,
         and solely as in your Judgment the evidence produced before you warrants and requires.</p>
      
      <p>“It Is not for me to say whether any crimes have been committed, or, if so, who committed
         them- these questions are solely wlifftn the province of the grand jury and are to
         be de I tortnined In the manner above outlined from the evidence which may he brought
         before you or which your diligence may procure.</p>
      
      <p>“Practically unlimited Inquisitorial powers are conferred upon you, and you should
         exercise the utmost diligence to the full extent of your skill and understanding,
         to Investigate both generally and specially the manner and extent to which the criminal
         laws of the state are being enforced, and if crimes have been committed, bring the
         criminals to the bar of Justice that they may receive merited punishment.”</p>

      <p>OMAHA LYNCHING NOT RACE RIOT</p>
      
      <p>THE lynching, the disgrace of which every worth while citizen of Omaha keenly feels
         and sincerely deplores, was not a race riot. Thank God, it did not come to that. Thank
         God that the bloodshed of such a catastrophe was mercifully averted. Had the mob carried
         out its threats to invade the sections where law-abiding, self-respecting. property-owning
         colored people reside to wreak vengeance upon them for the alleged, but unproven crimes
         of a few suspected lawless members of the race, the casualties on both sides would
         have been undoubtedly high; and our city would have been bequeathed a legacy of racial
         hatred which it is horrible even to contemplate. We are therefore profoundly grateful
         that our city was spared the added horror of a race riot.</p>
      
      <p>All, however, who believe in law and order, and that amity and good will should prevail
         among all classes of citizens, must be keenly alive to the danger that threatens when
         an undiscriminating and adverse sentiment is permitted to be created against any group
         of people because of the wrong-doing of particular individuals of that group. As an
         illustration of this, aside from that which our own people so obviously supplies,
         may be mentioned the sentiment against people of German descent during the recent
         war. Those whose Americanism and patriotism were beyond question were made to feel
         blighting proscription. What an easy matter it was to inflame passion against the
         most patriotic of this class of citizens by a sneering reference to their descent
         or parentage. Many of them doubtless felt as we do that the action or crime of some
         member of their race might at any moment endanger the life and property of unoffending
         ones.</p>
      
      <p>Wholesale condemnation of a group or a class for the wrong-doing of individuals is
         wrong and indefensible, and it is this reprehensible thing which causes race riots.</p>
      
      <p>In one of the last conversations we had with out heroic mayor, who is now deservedly
         an international character, he said:</p>
      
      <p>“I have no patience with this whole sale Indictment of a race or class, because of
         the crimes of bad individuals. The whole thing is wrong, eternally wrong, and all
         of us must do all we can to stop it. There are bad white men and bad black men, and
         crime is crime by whomsoever committed, and I could never see the wisdom or sense
         of the newspapers mentioning a man's race in connection with bis commission of a crime,
         which 1b so generally the practice where the offender is colored. There can be no
         question that such a practice helps to stir up and keep alive prejudice, and at this
         time of all times, when all over the world people’s nerves are unstrung and we are
         facing serious situations in our country as elsewhere. I do wish something could be
         done to stop this i thing which all sensible men admit is senseless, wrong and dangerous."</p>
      
      <p>These words of Mayor Ed P. Smith should be taken seriously to heart by all and from
         press, pulpit, bar and forum there should be sounded a clarion note of protest until
         the creating of adverse sentiment and the wholesale indictment of any group by the
         popular prevalent methods are abolished.</p>
      
      <p>There is no need of blinking the fact, indeed it were folly to do so, that’ in Omaha
         there were all the elements necessary for a sanguinary race riot that Sunday night.
         Those elements are still here and while it will be by no means so easy to evoke them
         as it would nave been and seemed imminent Sunday night, nevertheless it needs to be
         pointed out that all olus must do our full part and duty to see to it that there is
         not the slightest excuse given for any suggestion of any race conflict. There is no
         reason for it. Even though the greatly exaggerated reports of crimes by Negroes were
         true, that is no just reason why resentment should be felt against the law-abiding,
         self-respecting Negroes of the city. And because many Negroes keenly resent the false
         accusation that they are responsible for and sympathize with Negro criminals, this
         is no excuse for cultivating or holding ill-will or hatred against white people as
         white people, for thousands of them are our friends and are opposed to Injustice.</p>
      
      <p>We have had no race riot in Omaha. For this we all should be profoundly grateful.
         And all of us should show our gratitude by so living, acting, thinking and talking
         that anything like a race riot will be an absolute im possibility.</p>

      <p>NEGROES  AND ASSAULT</p>
      
      <p>IT has been given wide publicity that assaults and attempted assaults by Negroes upon
         white women and girls had so inflamed the public mind that summary vengeance was inevitable.
         It Is true that there have been many reports in the press of such crimes, some of
         which when run to earth were found to be groundless or unsubstantiated. The report
         of County Attorney Shotwell on the status of assault cases which was given to the
         press last Saturday throw’s a rather startling and unexpected light upon the situation,
         which should have a sobering effect upon those who are disposed to believe that Negroes
         are chief offenders in the commission of this heinous crime. It is a matter of record
         that there are now awaiting trial in district court seventeen persons held for this
         crime. Of this number FOUR are Negroes and THIRTEEN are WHITE MEN! One, a white man,
         Alfred J. Ramsey, who was accused of attempted assault upon a sixteen-year old colored
         girl, was found not guilty by a jury, and Jerry Dennis, a Negro, is serving a term
         in the penitentiary for attempted assault upon a young white woman. No Negro accused
         of this crime has been admitted to bail, and only three white rnen accused of attempted
         assault have been released under heavy bonds.</p>

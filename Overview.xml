                <p>History of The Monitor</p>
                <p>The Omaha Monitor, known as the Monitor for the bulk of its life, was an African American newspaper in Omaha, Nebraska. It ran issues from 1915 to 1929, and focused on the civic participation and racial equality of Omaha's black community. It was founded by John Albert Williams,an African American civic and religious leader and previous writer for the Enterprise, another black Omaha newspaper. Williams started the paper following the collapse of Enterprise, though an earlier version of it&#8212;the Mission Monitor&#8212;was in circulation in the late 1890s as a church periodical. The paper was national in its circulation. Williams left the paper the year prior to its closure. The paper was given to George H.W. Bullock, who renamed it to the Omaha Monitor until its closure in early 1929.</p>

            <p>Page One &#8211; Descriptions of Crime</p>
                <p>The first page of the publication that covers the Race Riot, just a few weeks after the events had taken place, gives thorough details on who all had been criminally involved and charged, along with a deeper look into all of the details of the ongoing investigations. This piece gives the reader accurate information on how many people were being prosecuted along with their names and physical descriptions.</p>
                <p>This page presents interesting pieces of information provided mostly by the  County Attorney, Alan  V. Shotwell. In his statements, he reviews the present status of every assault case against women in Douglas County in which complaints had been filed. Only four of these alleged assaulters were black, whereas there had been a total of thirteen alleged assaulters who were white. However, three of the white suspects had already been released on bonds ranging from $2,000 and up.</p>

                <p>Page Two &#8211; Ministers Speak Up</p>
                <p>Because The Omaha Monitor was published and edited by John Albert Williams, a nationally-known African American Episcopal priest who was also a civil rights activist, it comes to no surprise that the second page of the publication included a wide variety of quotations coming from different reverends in the area. The biggest takeaway from this was that many of these ministers laid most of the blame on yellow journalism, stating how it was because of certain daily papers that made such conditions possible.</p>

                <p>Page 3 &#8211; The Case Continues</p>
                <p>County Attorney Shotwell defends himself, stating that he has not been lenient with the assaulters of women and backed up this claim with more court records. Shotwell also lays most of the blame on yellow journalism for the riot and lynching of Will Brown, even providing a specific example which he says contributed to the tragedy. The interview responsible states the following:
                “On July 7 a South Side girl was ravished by a Negro who tied her to a tree. Police arrested a suspect and he was identified. Reports were widely circulated and are still heard over the streets that the prisoner was released.”
                The rest of this page goes on to describe how the public has been misled by false information and allegations which contributed to the race riot, to which they then support with solid facts and evidence from the court case.</p>

                <p>Page 4 &#8211; Omaha Lynching Not Race Riot</p>
                <p>According to The Omaha Monitor, the Omaha lynching that occurred on September 28th of 1919 should not be considered a race riot, but instead a lynching. The editors of this spread state that “had the mob carried out the its threats to invade the sections where law-abiding, self-respecting, property-owning colored people reside to wreak vengeance upon them for the alleged, but unproven crimes of a few suspected lawless members of the race, the casualties on both sides would have been undoubtedly high.”

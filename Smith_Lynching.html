      <h1>Lynching Near Same Place 25 Years Ago</h1><br/>
      
      <p>With the lynching of <a href="Annotations3.html#gesmith">George Smith</a> in mind, the new court house had, like some others of recent type, been built supposedly "mob proof"</p>
      
      <p>Smith, a negro, was lynched about a quarter-century ago from the old county jail on the same site and swung from a trolley pole at Seventeeth and Harney.
         He had outrages <a href="Annotations3.html#edsmith">a white girl</a>, daughter of a Union Pacific shop man, and she was believed his fifth victim.</p>
      
      <p>A mob with sledge hammers and cold chisels and railway rails stormed the old jail
         and after several hours got their victim. He was so badly scared that he was more
         dead than alive when strung up. <a href="Annotations3.html#maboyd">Mayor Boyd</a> ordered the crowd to disperse but it paid no attention. The he called out the firemen
         to play streams on the crowd and disperse it, but the mob cut the hose.</p>
